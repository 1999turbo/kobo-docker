# Warning
If you started running KoBo Toolbox using a version of `kobo-docker` from before to [2016.10.13](https://github.com/kobotoolbox/kobo-docker/commit/316b1464c86e2c447ca88c10d383662b4f2e4ac6), actions that recreate the `kobocat` container (including `docker-compose up ...` under some circumstances) will result in losing access to user media files (e.g. responses to photo questions). Safely stored media files can be found in `kobo-docker/.vols/kobocat_media_uploads/`.

Files that were not safely stored can be found inside Docker volumes as well as in your current and any previous `kobocat` containers. One quick way of finding these is directly searching the Docker root directory. The root directory can be found by running `docker info` and looking for the "Docker Root Dir" entry (not to be confused with the storage driver's plain "Root Dir").

Once this is noted, you can `docker-compose stop` and search for potentially-missed media attachment directories with something like `sudo find ${YOUR_DOCKER_ROOT_DIR}/ -name attachments`. These attachment directories will be of the format `.../${SOME_KOBO_USER}/attachments` and you will want to back up each entire KoBo user's directory (the parent of the `attachments` directory) for safe keeping, then move/merge them under `.vols/kobocat_media_uploads/`, creating that directory if it doesn't exist and taking care not to overwrite any newer files present there if it does exist. Once this is done, clear out the old container and any attached volumes with `docker-compose rm -v kobocat`, then `git pull` the latest `kobo-docker` code, `docker-compose pull` the latest images for `kobocat` and the rest, and your media files will be safely stored from there on.

# Setup procedure:
1. Clone this repository, retaining the directory name `kobo-docker`.
2. [Install Docker Compose on 64-bit Linux](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). Power users on Mac OS X and Windows can try [the new Docker beta for those platforms](https://blog.docker.com/2016/03/docker-for-mac-windows-beta/), but there are known issues with filesystem syncing on those platforms.
3. Determine whether you want to create an HTTP-only **local** instance of KoBo Toolbox, or a HTTPS publicly-accessible **server** instance. Local instances will use [`docker-compose.local.yml`](./docker-compose.local.yml) and [`envfile.local.txt`](./envfile.local.txt), whereas server instances will use [`docker-compose.server.yml`](./docker-compose.server.yml) and [`envfile.server.txt`](./envfile.server.txt) instead.  
**NOTE:** For server instances, **you are expected to meet the usual basic requirements of serving over HTTPS**. That is, **public (not local) DNS records** for the domain and subdomains as specified in [`envfile.server.txt`](./envfile.server.txt), as well as a **CA-signed** wildcard (or SAN) SSL certificate+key pair valid for those subdomains, and **some basic knowledge of Nginx server administration and the use of SSL**.
4. Based on your desired instance type, create a symlink named `docker-compose.yml` to either [`docker-compose.local.yml`](./docker-compose.local.yml) or [`docker-compose.server.yml`](./docker-compose.server.yml) (e.g. `ln -s docker-compose.local.yml docker-compose.yml`). Alternatively, you can skip this step and explicitly prefix all Docker Compose commands as follows: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml ...`.
5. Pull the latest images from Docker Hub: `docker-compose pull`. **Note:** Pulling updated images doesn't remove the old ones, so if your drive is filling up, try removing outdated images with e.g. `docker rmi`.
6. Edit the appropriate environment file for your instance type, [`envfile.local.txt`](./envfile.local.txt) or [`envfile.server.txt`](./envfile.server.txt), filling in **all** mandatory variables, and optional variables as needed.
8. Optionally enable additional settings for your Google Analytics token, S3 bucket, e-mail settings, etc. by editing the files in [`envfiles/`](./envfiles).
9. **Server-only steps:**
  1. Make a `secrets` directory in the project root and copy the SSL certificate and key files to `secrets/ssl.crt` and `secrets/ssl.key` respectively. **The certificate and key are expected to use exactly these filenames and must comprise either a wildcard or SAN certificate+key pair which are valid for the domain and subdomains specified in [`envfile.server.txt`](./envfile.server.txt).**
  2. If testing on a server that is not publicly accessible at the subdomains you've specified in [`envfile.server.txt`](./envfile.server.txt), put an entry in your host machine's `/etc/hosts` file for each of the three subdomains you entered to reroute such requests to your machine's address (e.g. `192.168.1.123 kf-local.kobotoolbox.org`). Also, uncomment and customize the `extra_hosts` directives in [`docker-compose.server.yml`](./docker-compose.server.yml).
<!-- 8. Optionally stop and clear previously built `kobo-docker` containers: `docker-compose stop; docker-compose rm`. -->
<!-- 9. Optionally clear persisted files (e.g. the Postgres database) from previous runs, **taking care that you are in the `kobo-docker` directory**: `sudo rm -rf .vols/ log/`. -->
10. Build any images you've chosen to manually override: `docker-compose build`.
11. Start the server: `docker-compose up -d` (or without the `-d` option to run in the foreground).
11. Container output can be followed with `docker-compose logs -f`. For an individual container, logs can be followed by using the container name from your `docker-compose.yml` with e.g. `docker-compose logs -f enketo_express`.

"Local" setup users can now reach KoBo Toolbox at `http://${HOST_ADDRESS}:${KPI_PUBLIC_PORT}` (substituting in the values entered in [`envfile.local.txt`](./envfile.local.txt)), while "server" setups can be reached at `https://${KOBOFORM_PUBLIC_SUBDOMAIN}.${PUBLIC_DOMAIN_NAME}` (similarly substituting from [`envfile.server.txt`](./envfile.server.txt)). Be sure to periodically update your containers, especially `nginx`, for security updates by pulling new changes from this `kobo-docker` repo then running e.g. `docker-compose pull && docker-compose up -d`.

# Backups
Automatic, periodic backups of KoBoCAT media, MongoDB, and Postgres can be individually enabled by uncommenting (and optionally customizing) the `*_BACKUP_SCHEDULE` variables in your `envfile`. When enabled, timestamped backups will be placed in `backups/kobocat`, `backups/mongo`, and `backups/postgres`, respectively. Redis backups are currently not generated, but the `redis_main` DB file is updated every 5 minutes and can always be found in `.vols/redis_main_data/`.

Backups can also be manually triggered when `kobo-docker` is running by executing the the following commands:
```
docker exec -it kobodocker_kobocat_1 /srv/src/kobocat/docker/backup_media.bash
docker exec -it kobodocker_mongo_1 /srv/backup_mongo.bash
docker exec -it kobodocker_postgres_1 /srv/backup_postgres.bash
```
